title: Memento Mori
---

**A word from Messenjah:**

'Memento Mori' is Latin for 'Remember You Will Die'.
This is an anthology that contains poems on a topic I know I should not conventionally be concerned about, considering my age. But I am. And that topic is death.
Following the passing of my dad last year, I've spent time writing about my thoughts, meditations and emotional experiences.
I now feel ready to share my thoughts in written poetry.
