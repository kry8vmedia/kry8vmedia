Dear reader,

Kry8v Media is a business. We earn funds through the work we do on this site.

We want to be as clear and transparent as possible so as to not lose your trust.

Below is a list of how we earn money on this site:

Sales of our own products
Affiliate commissions
YouTube advertisements
Partnerships

I participate in a few affiliate programs, including (but not limited to) Amazon, HostGator, NameCheap, and Lynda.

All of the products we receive affiliate commissions for are ones that I believe in whole-heartedly and in most cases use ourselves.

In the case of partnerships with companies, we only agree to a partnership if we believe in the product and the company itself.
